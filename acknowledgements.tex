We are grateful to the Anonymous Innovation Fund and the Anonymous
Student-Faculty Research Fund for providing the resources to offer
this camp at low or no cost to our campers.  The Mellon Foundation
has supported the growth of digital humanities at our institution
and, while it provided no direct funding to this project, that
broader iniative influenced the direction of the project.  Our IRB
provided useful feedback on the instrument and the project.  Our
fellow students graciously worked with the campers on their research
projects, providing advice on both posters and presentations.  Junior
counselors Name One, Name Two, and Name Three provided necessary
support for this project; we know it's hard to support someone
else's curriculum, and they did a great job.  Finally, we appreciate
the enthusiastic participation of our campers!
