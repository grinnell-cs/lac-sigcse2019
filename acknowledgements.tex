We are grateful to the Grinnell College Innovation Fund and the
Grinnell College Student-Faculty Research Fund for providing the
resources to offer this camp at low or no cost to our campers.  The
Mellon Foundation has supported the growth of digital humanities
at Grinnell through a joint ``Digital Bridges'' grant with the
University of Iowa and, while it provided no direct funding to this
project, that broader iniative influenced the direction of the
project.  Erik Simpson's \textit{Lighting the Page} course was particularly
influential.  Our IRB provided useful feedback on the instrument
and the project.  Our fellow students graciously worked with the
campers on their research projects, providing advice on both posters
and presentations.  Junior counselors Gabby Dahlby Albright, Hans
Larsson, and Daniel Rebelsky provided necessary support for this
project; we know it's hard to support someone else's curriculum,
and they did a great job.  Finally, we appreciate the enthusiastic
participation of our campers!
